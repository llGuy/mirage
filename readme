This is an experimental renderer with SDFs as rendering primitives.

TODO: (forget about lighting for now - let's deal with visibility)
- Voxelize the scene on the GPU - each voxel should contain information
  about which primitives affect that region of space
- Rasterize fixed (screen space) size where there are SDF primitives
